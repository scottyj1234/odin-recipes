        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Whisk eggs, honey, Dijon mustard, soy sauce, and garlic together in a bowl. Mix bread crumbs, salt, and pepper together in a shallow bowl.
            </li>
            <li>
                Heat 1/2 to 1 inch of vegetable oil in a heavy skillet to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). You can also use a deep fryer.
            </li>
            <li>
                Put chicken slices in the egg mixture and knead until fully coated. Press chicken in the bread crumbs until evenly coated.
            </li>
            <li>
                Working in batches, carefully place chicken in the hot oil using tongs and cook until no longer pink in the center and browned on the outside, 3 to 4 minutes per side. Drain on paper towels and serve with lemon wedges.
